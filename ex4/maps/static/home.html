            <h2>My home</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>I live in a house made by my parents, with my parents and grandparents. My parents built this house for us with a lot of hard work. It has three rooms, one balcony, one kitchen, two bathrooms, and a terrace. The house is open towards the south and very airy.</p>
